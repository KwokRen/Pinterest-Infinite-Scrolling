# Challenge #1 - Infinite Scroll

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of a static JSON file, and using the data recieved back from that to implement a "Pinterest" type of website which includes a infinite scrolling implementation feature.

# Description

Taking the static JSON file and using the data, the application will load a frontend web application (no backend required since the data is directly fetched from the JSON file which is included in the code) that will have different pins about black cats. Each cat has a unique image, and the website will allow you to scroll infinitely until you've reached the end. 

# Getting started

## Dependencies

Since intersection observer was implemented, Internet Explorer will not be able to run this application efficiently.
## Installing

You want to install any dependencies (React in this case)

``` 
npm i
```
## Executing program

After installing all dependencies, you can start the application from the terminal using this command

```
npm start
```
